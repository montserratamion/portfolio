								<p>I am passionate about sharing my knowledge of chemistry and computational simulation with the public. I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn about these fascinating subjects and to appreciate their potential to improve our lives.</p>

								<p>In 2019, I gave a talk to German students about computational chemistry and drug discovery. I explained how computational methods are used to design and test new drugs, and I discussed the challenges and opportunities of this field.</p>
									
								<p>In 2016, I visited two Chilean schools and talked to students about the importance of depression and how computational chemistry could be used to treat this condition. I explained the biological basis of depression and how computational methods could be used to identify and develop new drugs that target specific molecular pathways.</p>
									
								<p>I am also a volunteer mentor for young scientists who are interested in computational chemistry and drug discovery. I provide them with guidance and support as they develop their research skills and pursue their career goals.</p>
								
								<p>I am committed to using my knowledge and skills to make a positive impact on the world. I believe that science can help us to solve some of the most pressing challenges facing humanity, and I am passionate about sharing my passion for science with others.</p>
									
								<p>I strongly believe that computational chemistry and drug discovery are both important topics, and it is important to educate the public about them. Talk on depression is imperative, as this is a serious mental health condition that affects millions of people around the world. I am confident that my volunteer work has the potential of making a difference in the lives of people and students.</p>
